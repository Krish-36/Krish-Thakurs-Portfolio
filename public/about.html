<h1>About Me</h1>

  My name is Krish Thakur, and I am a Toronto-based tech enthusiast with a passion 
  for data analytics, innovation, and economics. I have a strong background in web

  One of my main areas of interest is the exciting field of AI/Machine Learning. 
  I am fascinated by these technologies' incredible potential to change the way we 
  live and work, and I am always eager to learn more about their capabilities and how
  they can be used to solve real-world problems. My interests extend beyond the 
  tech world, as I am also intrigued by topics such as financial analysis, data, 
  business planning, and economics.
